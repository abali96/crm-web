<!-- forms use get and post requests - we "fake" the other ones

request is determined by both verb and path
GET /contacts (returns data to you)
POST /contacts (creates a resource on the other end)
if POST or GET is not explicitly stated as the method, I think it's by default a GET request
-->
<div><h1>Create new contact</h1></div>

<form action="/contacts" method="post"> 
					<!-- form is a block level attriute -->
	<input type="text" name="first_name" placeholder="First name">
	<!-- using value="defaultvalue" basically has the box prefilled. Don't use placehoder if it's a long form - only use it for hints because if it's a long form, the user comes back to the top and has no context for what that box was for. Actually label the boxes when it's a long form! -->
